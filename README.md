# hello-world

Hello everyone.

Quite a lot has been happening to me in term of exposure in the world of ICT. I realise ther's much I don't know and there's much I'm now familiar with.

At first,there is the scare, then the discouragement, the seemingly difficult and much later the possibilities as you approach the world of ICT.
